### Web Store App

This is a simle React-based web application designed to mimic an online store with data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs). The idea behind this project was to get more comfortable with React, especially routing to easily move between pages. I also used TypeScript to practice working with types.

### Key Features
<li>Full routing support, including a custom 404 page</li>
<li>Displays data fetched from both the Fake Store API and localStorage</li>
<li>Product details page</li>
<li>Input validation</li>
<li>LocalStorage Support</li>
<li>Real-time filtering</li>

### Technologies used
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>localStorage</li>
<li>Material-UI (MUI)</li>
<li>Fake Store API</li>
